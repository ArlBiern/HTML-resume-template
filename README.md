# :page_facing_up: HTML resume :page_facing_up:

Please see **sample of HTML resume** at [GitHub Pages](https://arlbiern.github.io/HTML-resume-template/).

This is my HTML resume sample. It was made as a task for CodersCamp bootcamp (2019/2020).   
The aim of this task was to create resume without any usage of JavaScript.
